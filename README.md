# CASbootstrapPortfoilo

The portfolio contains my backstory in the "about me" page along with my image. 

In my "portfolio" page, there are images that refect my presonality and life.

In my "contact" page, I created a means of contacting me.

The portfolio is built with a responsive layout via bootstrap so that it can repsond to the difference in sizing with devices. Elements such as the navbar, container, and footer react to change layout of multiple devices. Also, the footer is sticky so that it won't float above the bottom of the scream.
